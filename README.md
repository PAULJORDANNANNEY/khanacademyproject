# khanacademyproject
Basically, here is the link to it on khan academy https://www.khanacademy.org/computer-programming/b/5981747228524544
(don't quote me on this) I believe this will only run on processing js, also, my github account only allows me to have one webpage posted so to view the code in action, if you will, please view it on the khan acadmey website, the creator/author is me (Paul Nanney), in this code I have an animation of a doctor and this is for a healthcare company and it would be so that the patient could consolodate all of their medical situations into one doctor.
